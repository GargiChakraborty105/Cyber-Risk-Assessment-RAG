# Cyber-Risk-Assessment-RAG

This application evaluates cybersecurity risks using three datasets: User Behavior, Incident History, and Mock Tests. It assigns Red-Amber-Green (RAG) ratings for individual employees and departments based on defined risk parameters like user access behavior, incident severity, security awareness, and data sharing practices. The tool generates detailed risk assessment reports with actionable recommendations and supports CSV/Excel inputs with a web-based UI for data upload and real-time visualization.
